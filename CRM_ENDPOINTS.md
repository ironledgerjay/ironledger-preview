## Integration Notes

### For Admin CRM Development:
1. **Primary Workflow**: Use `/api/crm/doctors/pending` to fetch doctors awaiting approval
2. **Approval Action**: Use `/api/crm/doctors/{id}/verify` to approve/reject doctors
3. **Real-time Updates**: Poll `/api/crm/notifications` for new registrations
4. **Activity Monitoring**: Use `/api/crm/activity` to track all platform actions

### Data Flow:
1. Doctor registers via main site â†’ Creates user and doctor profile with `isVerified: false`
2. System creates high-priority notification in `/api/crm/notifications`
3. Activity logged in `/api/crm/activity` 
4. Admin CRM fetches pending doctors via `/api/crm/doctors/pending`
5. Admin approves/rejects via `/api/crm/doctors/{id}/verify`
6. System logs approval action and notifies doctor

### Security:
- All endpoints are accessible without authentication for development
- In production, implement proper authentication and authorization
- All actions are logged for audit trails
